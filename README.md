# 🎙️ Smart Podcast Generation from Academic Research Papers

A Generative AI-powered application that converts academic research papers into engaging podcast-style content. The system analyzes research papers, identifies research gaps, simplifies technical concepts, and generates conversational podcast scripts along with supporting resources such as show notes, timestamps, key terms, and downloadable documents.

## 📖 Overview

Academic research papers are often lengthy and difficult for non-specialists to understand. This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transform complex research papers into easy-to-understand podcast-style content.

The application improves accessibility to scientific research by enabling users to consume research through engaging audio-based content.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The rapid growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly difficult for researchers, students, and the general public to consume and understand academic literature.

Research papers are often:
- Highly technical
- Time-consuming to read
- Difficult for non-domain experts

This project addresses these challenges by automatically converting research papers into podcast-style content, making scientific knowledge more accessible and engaging.
